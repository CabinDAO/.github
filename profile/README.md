[Cabin](https://cabin.city) is building a network city of modern villages. 

Together, we are growing intergenerational neighborhoods: places where we know our neighbors and 
raise kids together. Cabin neighborhoods are located in walkable pockets of family-friendly 
urbanism with nearby parks and nature. Our goal is to create neighborhoods where we'd want to grow up.
